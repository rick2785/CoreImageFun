Core Image is a powerful framework that lets you easily apply filters to images. You can get all kinds of effects, such as modifying the vibrance, hue, or exposure. Core Image filters can also be chained together to apply multiple effects to an image or video frame at once. The multiple filters are combined into a single filter that is applied to the image. This makes it very efficient compared to processing the image through each filter, one at a time.
